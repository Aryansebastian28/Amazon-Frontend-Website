This project is a frontend replica of the Amazon website, created using only HTML and CSS. It faithfully reproduces the Amazon platform's layout, styling, and visual elements, providing a familiar user experience for browsing products, and proceeding to checkout.
FUTURE PLANS 
In the future, I intend to enhance this project by integrating a backend component to enable dynamic functionalities such as user authentication, product management, and order processing. Stay tuned for updates as the project progresses!
